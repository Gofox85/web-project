<h2>About</h2>
<p>Adhik Ravichandran is a Tamil film director, screenwriter, and occasional actor whose career is defined by both significant commercial hits and notable setbacks. He made a successful debut with the adult comedy Trisha Illana Nayanthara (2015), but faced failures with subsequent films like Anbanavan Asaradhavan Adangadhavan (2017) and Bagheera (2023). His career experienced a major revitalization with the blockbuster sci-fi action-comedy Mark Antony (2023), which grossed over â‚¹100 crore worldwide. Following this, he directed the 2025 action film Good Bad Ugly starring Ajith Kumar. Beyond directing, Ravichandran has taken on acting roles in other films, including supporting parts in Nerkonda Paarvai and K-13.</p>
