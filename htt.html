<h2>About</h2>
<p>Hiphop Tamizha is an Indian musical duo, consisting of Adhithya "Adhi" Ramachandran Venkatapathy and R. Jeeva, widely recognized as pioneers of the Tamil hip-hop music scene. They initially rose to fame as independent musicians, notably with their viral song "Club le Mabbu le" in 2011, which earned them a launch by the brand Remy Martin. The following year, they released Hip Hop Tamizhan, celebrated as India's first Tamil hip-hop album. While Jeeva has often maintained a low public profile, Adhi became the more prominent face of the duo, eventually expanding into the Tamil film industry as an actor, director, and music composer. Their work includes a mix of independent releases and music for numerous films, showcasing their fusion of hip-hop with regional sounds. Adhi has also starred in and directed several movies, such as Meesaya Murukku (2017), and has continued to build on his multifaceted career.</p>
